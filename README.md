pixelTail Games has discontinued supporting the [Cinema](https://github.com/pixeltailgames/cinema) gamemode since around march 2018, no fixes were made on their side to get the usual video services running again.
This standalone ***"fork"*** of Cinema focuses on fixing the problems and extending it with some new features/services. The minimum requirement is that you need the ***x86-64 BETA Branch to watch YouTube only***, otherwise you have to use [CEF Codec Fix](https://github.com/solsticegamestudios/GModCEFCodecFix) as well.

#### Known Issues ####
* Internet Archive is sometimes slow, due to their overloaded systems
* Dailymotion is blocked in some countries (Russia, China, Kazakhstan, North Korea, etc)
* Depending on the country, the government can prevent the playback of videos and thus also prevent websites from loading.
* DNS-based filters (PI-Hole, eBlocker, AdGuard, etc) can render the displayed pages unusable if configured incorrectly.
